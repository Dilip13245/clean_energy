                        <ol class="list-styled slide-in">
                            <li><strong>Custom Equipment Design:</strong> We begin each project by working closely with
                                you to understand the specific requirements of your operation. Our engineering team uses
                                advanced design software and tools to create equipment that meets your exact
                                specifications. From the conceptual phase through detailed design, we ensure that each
                                piece of equipment is optimized for performance, durability, and ease of use.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prototype Development:</strong> Before moving to full-scale production, we offer
                                prototype development to validate the design and functionality of the custom equipment.
                                Our team builds a working model of the equipment that allows you to evaluate
                                performance, identify potential issues, and make any necessary adjustments. This
                                iterative approach ensures that the final product meets your expectations and performs
                                as intended in real-world applications.</li>
                            <li><strong>Precision Machining and Fabrication:</strong> Once the design is finalized, we
                                proceed with precision machining and fabrication. Using state-of-the-art CNC machines
                                and skilled craftsmanship, we produce high-precision parts and components that fit
                                together perfectly. Our fabrication services include welding, cutting, bending, and
                                assembly, ensuring that each piece of custom equipment is constructed to the highest
                                quality standards.</li>
                            <li><strong>Material Selection:</strong> We carefully select materials that meet the demands
                                of your specific application, ensuring the right balance of strength, durability, and
                                corrosion resistance. Whether you need stainless steel, aluminum, high-strength alloys,
                                or specialty materials, we provide the best material options for your equipment to
                                ensure it performs optimally in your environment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Electrical and Control Systems Integration:</strong> For equipment that requires
                                electrical systems, automation, or control features, we integrate cutting-edge control
                                systems, PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), and other electrical components to
                                provide seamless operation. Whether you need simple on/off control or complex feedback
                                loops, we ensure that your equipment operates efficiently and reliably. We can also
                                incorporate sensors, actuators, and other automation elements for enhanced performance.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Assembly and Integration:</strong> After all components are fabricated, we
                                proceed with the mechanical and electrical assembly of the custom equipment. Our team
                                ensures that every part is installed and integrated correctly, including hydraulic,
                                pneumatic, and electrical systems. We handle all aspects of equipment assembly, ensuring
                                that it functions smoothly and meets the required specifications.</li>
                            <li><strong>Testing and Quality Assurance:</strong> We conduct comprehensive testing to
                                ensure that the custom equipment operates as intended. This includes functional testing,
                                load testing, safety checks, and performance evaluations. We also conduct thorough
                                inspections to verify that the equipment meets all quality standards and regulatory
                                requirements. Any necessary adjustments are made to ensure optimal performance before
                                delivery.</li>
                            <li><strong>Custom Modifications and Upgrades:</strong> In addition to building new custom
                                equipment, we also offer modification and upgrade services for existing machinery. If
                                your equipment needs enhancements or improvements to meet evolving operational needs, we
                                provide tailored solutions to modify and optimize your machinery, extending its useful
                                life and improving its efficiency.</li>
